# Theme Improvement Plan

## Information Gathered:
- Current theme: Dark background (#0B0F1A) with orange/blue animated shapes
- Primary accent: cyan (#22D3EE), blue (#3B82F6)
- Text colors: #E5E7EB (light gray), #9CA3AF (gray)
- Issue: Text visibility and visual appeal not satisfactory

## Plan:
- [ ] Update style.css with a new modern theme:
  - [ ] Change background to a softer gradient (purple to blue or deep navy)
  - [ ] Improve text contrast for better readability
  - [ ] Simplify animated background shapes (reduce number and opacity)
  - [ ] Update card styles with better shadows and borders
  - [ ] Improve button styles with better hover effects
  - [ ] Update sidebar and navbar styling
  - [ ] Ensure all text is clearly visible

## New Theme Design:
- Background: Deep navy gradient with subtle purple undertones
- Primary color: Vibrant purple (#8B5CF6) or Blue (#3B82F6)
- Text: Pure white (#FFFFFF) for headings, light gray (#E5E7EB) for body
- Cards: Semi-transparent dark with subtle borders
- Better contrast ratios for accessibility

## Files to Edit:
- style.css (main theme file)
